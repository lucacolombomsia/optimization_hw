Homework #3

1.	Do problem #2 from Chapter 1 of SCND
A producer of dog food is trying to decide whether they should change the number and locations of their warehouses to better meet projected demand over the next three years. They do a study and determine that their transportation and warehousing costs will be $51 million if they stick with their current structure. They have determined that if they close two warehouses and open two new warehouses, their costs will drop to $50.5 million. Assume that all other costs stay the same. Should they make the change?

KEY POINT: Less than 1% change; is there a statistically significant difference here? It is very unlikely that such a small difference would be significant
Other potential issues to discuss:
-	Effect on service level
-	Are we able to find people with the right skills in the new location?
-	Organizational challenges: is our company ready for this change? 
-	Do the new warehouses have the necessary characteristics? Dog food might require to be stored in specific conditions of humidity and what not
-	Are we assuming no cost of switching from one structure to another?
-	Public relations: are there risks associated to moving warehouses? Is it going to be bad publicity?
-	Would this impact our relationship with competitors? In what way?
-	Would this jeopardize our relationship with trucking company?

2.	Do problem #3 from Chapter 1 of SCND
You need to set up a mathematical optimization model. Assume you are modeling a supply chain for a business with ten warehouses and 1,000 customers. If you set up the model to minimize cost, set the decision variables to decide which warehouse should serve which customers, and set up no constraints, why would you expect the minimal cost to come back as$0?

You need a constraint that says that customer demand is always met. Otherwise, the model will suggest distributing no product at all, as this is the solution that minimizes the cost. However, this would clearly not be an optimal solution.

3.	Do problem #4 from Chapter 1 of SCND
You are helping a firm determine their future transportation costs between their plant in Dallas and their warehouse in Atlanta. Your best estimate, with the data you have, is that the cost will be between $1.70 and $1.80 per mile. You decide to use $1.75 as your cost because it is the mid-point. If you are asked to spend more time seeing whether the number should be closer to $1.70 or $1.80, what would be your argument against further refining this number?

Given our estimate and our assumption, at most we will be off by only 5 cents. More precision is not necessarily better. The data just needs to be precise enough for us to make the decision we are making. Collecting more precise data will require time and this might delay the actual decision making; we could end up losing more by not acting promptly than what we would gain thanks to a more precise estimate of the cost. Also, we are making predictions about the future; predictions inevitably come with some degree of uncertainty.
